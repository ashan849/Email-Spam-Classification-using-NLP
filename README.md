## Project Overview

Email spam detection is a crucial application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to filter unwanted or malicious emails from a user's inbox. This project builds a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam) using text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms. The goal is to improve email security and reduce the time users spend managing unsolicited emails.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled email messages categorized as spam or ham. It typically contains raw email text along with their labels. Common datasets used in spam detection include the "SpamAssassin Public Corpus" or the "SMS Spam Collection."

- Number of emails: e.g., 5,000+  
- Classes: Spam, Ham  
- Data format: CSV or plain text with labels

## Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather and clean labeled email data.  
2. **Text Preprocessing:** Remove stopwords, punctuation, and apply tokenization and stemming/lemmatization.  
4. **Model Training:** Use classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).  
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model is evaluated using:

- **Accuracy:** Overall correctness of the model predictions.  
- **Precision:** Proportion of predicted spam emails that are actually spam.  
- **Recall:** Proportion of actual spam emails correctly identified.  
- **F1-Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall providing a balance between them.  
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualizes the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.  

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with deep learning models like LSTM or transformers for better context understanding.  
- Use larger and more diverse datasets for improved generalization.  
- Implement real-time spam filtering and integration with email clients.  
- Enhance preprocessing to better handle email-specific artifacts like headers and attachments.  
- Automate hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.
